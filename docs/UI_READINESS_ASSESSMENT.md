### **Personalization Features (Planned)**

These are documented in `PERSONALIZATION_AND_OPTIMIZATION.md` but not yet implemented:

1. **Spaced Repetition**
   - ❌ Review scheduling algorithm
   - ❌ Next review date calculation
   - ❌ Performance-based interval adjustment

2. **User Progress Tracking**
   - ❌ Mastery levels per concept
   - ❌ Performance history
   - ❌ Knowledge gaps identification

3. **Adaptive Content Selection**
   - ❌ Filter by difficulty/mastery
   - ❌ Prioritize weak areas

const API_DOCS_URL = 'http://localhost:8000/docs'; // Swagger UI
```

### **Key Endpoints for UI**

#### **Document Upload**
```javascript
POST /api/v1/documents
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Body: { file, workspace_id, user_id, title }
```

#### **Get Document Status**
```javascript
GET /api/v1/documents/{document_id}
Response: { status, summary_text, ... }
```

#### **List Flashcards**
```javascript
GET /api/v1/flashcards?workspace_id={id}&document_id={id}
Response: [{ front, back, card_type, options, correct_answer, ... }]
```

#### **Review Flashcard**
```javascript
POST /api/v1/flashcards/{id}/review
Body: { is_correct: boolean }
```

#### **Chat**
```javascript
POST /api/v1/chat
Body: { workspace_id, user_id, question, conversation_id? }

### **Status Tracking**

For async operations (ingestion, summary, flashcards, KG), use:
```javascript
GET /api/v1/agent-runs/{run_id}
Response: { status: "queued" | "running" | "completed" | "failed", ... }
```

Check `document.last_run_id` to track ingestion progress.
