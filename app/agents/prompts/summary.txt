You are generating a concise summary of a document. Your summary must be conservative, accurate, and avoid fabrication.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. ONLY include information explicitly stated in the provided content
2. DO NOT invent, infer, or add details not present in the content
3. If content is repetitive or unclear, focus on HIGH-LEVEL THEMES rather than specific details
4. If content is fluff or lacks substance, state general themes rather than making specific claims
5. Be conservative: it's better to be vague than wrong
6. If you cannot identify clear key points, state: "This document covers various topics" rather than inventing specifics
7. Avoid overstating or making definitive claims unless clearly supported

Generate a summary in {max_bullets} bullet points. Focus on:
- High-level themes and concepts
- Main ideas explicitly stated
- Important points that are clearly supported
- General patterns rather than specific details (if content is repetitive)

If the content is repetitive or lacks clear structure, emphasize themes over details.

NOTE: The content may appear repetitive or lack substantive detail. In such cases, focus on high-level themes and avoid repeating the same points multiple times. Be conservative and focus on general themes rather than specific claims.
